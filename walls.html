 <p>
Braco village is built in an area with plenty of stone and this has resulted in
there being many walls in the village. The village is just over 200 years old and
many of the walls date from the mid to late 1800’s. Some of the walls have
been maintained better than others. The walls round the old graveyard in the
centre of the village and the wall in Front Street, the main street through the
village, were our main concern.
</p>

 <p>
Perth and Kinross County Community Payback team were approached to see if
they were able to repair the walls. A Community Payback Order is part of the
Justice System and is given as an alternative to custody and among the range of
options is one for doing unpaid work. The teams are small, 4- 8 people under a
supervisor, and the outdoor ground work/wall building team agreed to repair the
designated walls. Although labour is provided free, the project is required to
pay for materials, in the case of the walls, sand and cement. As there is no
public toilet in Braco, a portable toilet also requires to be provided.
</p>

<p>
The Community Payback Team are mainly available late autumn, winter and
early spring and they can only work on dryish days with no frost. Depending on
priorities they may be working on other locations on good wall repair days. It
has therefore taken some time to do the walls so far. The work done has been to
replace loose stones and cement areas where the stones are in place but loose, a
small part of the wall in Front Street had to be completely rebuilt. There have
been many appreciative comment on the improved appearance of the walls and
Ardoch Garden Club are most grateful for the financial support given by ADT
to this project.

This made it a great event to showcase the talents of Ardoch Strings (also supported by the ADT) and brought the whole community together. We are grateful for the money granted by ADT to provide refreshments, with additional mince pies provided by Tesco.
